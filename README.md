# Landscapes

Wondering if there was an alternative to the "corners->middle->sides->recurse" method of generating Fractal Landscapes, I found this [random mesh division](http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39559-automatic-terrain-generation/content/html/terrain_generation_introduction.html) technique.

Translating that to Ruby was a complete disaster.

Translating it to C has met with slightly more success.
